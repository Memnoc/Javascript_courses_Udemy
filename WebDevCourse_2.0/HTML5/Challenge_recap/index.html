    <p>Earth, our home planet, is the only planet in its solar system known to harbor life. All of the things we need to survive
        are provided under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the uninhabitable void of space.</p>

    <p>Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that are often unpredictable. Air, water, land, and life—including humans—combine
        forces to create a constantly changing world.</p>

    <h3>Earth Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system.</li>
        <li>Earth is 92,955,820 miles (149,597,891 kilometers) away from the sun.</li>
        <li>At 7,917.5 miles (12,742 km), Earth's diameter is just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.
        </li>
        <li>The four seasons are a result of Earth's axis of rotation being tilted more than 23 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>The length of a year on Earth is 365 days, 6 hours, and 16 minutes.</li>
        <li>The length of a day on Earth is 23 hours and 56 minutes.</li>

    <h3>Protective Atmosphere</h3>

    <p>Near the surface, an ocean of air that consists of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other ingredients
        envelops us. This atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and short-term local weather; shields us from nearly
        all harmful radiation coming from the sun; and protects us from meteors as well. Satellites have revealed that the
        upper atmosphere actually swells by day and contracts by night due to solar activity.</p>

    <p>Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into
        a teardrop shape. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun. The magnetic
        field does not fade off into space, but has definite boundaries.</p>
